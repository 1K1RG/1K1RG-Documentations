Feature Review Document: SNP-Seek Genotype Search

The SNP-Seek Genotype Search feature is a critical tool to support the 1K Rice Genome Project – Philippines, which aims to sequence, analyze, and utilize the genomes of 1,001 traditional Philippine rice varieties. This project seeks to accelerate the discovery of genetic markers linked to important agronomic traits such as yield, stress tolerance, disease resistance, and nutritional quality.
SNP-Seek enables researchers to efficiently query, analyze, and visualize SNPs and genotypes across thousands of rice accessions, making it highly relevant for genomic characterization, varietal comparison, and marker-assisted selection. By leveraging SNP-Seek's capabilities, the 1K Rice Genome Project can identify unique alleles in Philippine landraces, build haplotype maps, and integrate genomic data into breeding pipelines.
This feature supports both fundamental genomic research and applied crop improvement, providing a user-friendly interface and powerful back-end database architecture to handle complex genotype data queries. Its compatibility with large-scale datasets and its integration-ready API make it an ideal platform to extend the impact and utility of the 1K Rice Genome Project for national food security and agricultural sustainability.
Key Genotype Search Features:
Search by Genomic Position or Gene
You can input a chromosome number and coordinate or a gene ID to retrieve SNPs in that region and view the genotypes across accessions.


Filter by Alleles
The interface allows you to specify reference or alternate alleles, making it easier to track specific variants across rice lines.


Genotype Matrix
Results are displayed in a genotype matrix, where each row represents a SNP and each column a rice variety. Genotypes (e.g., AA, TT, CC, GG, or missing data “.”) can be sorted and filtered.


Export Options
Genotypic data can be downloaded in multiple formats, such as VCF, tab-delimited tables, or FASTA, for downstream analysis.


Haplotype View
For selected genomic regions, SNP-Seek can display haplotypes, allowing users to examine patterns of variation within and between subpopulations.
